# Knowledge contracts and decisions

## Purpose

A reviewer should be able to answer two questions without rereading old pull
requests:

1. What behavior has a human already decided?
2. Is this pull request making a new decision that needs a human?

## System model

Astryx keeps different facts in different places:

- Component contracts describe aggregate behavior one component promises.
- Module contracts describe an independently contractible public hook, plugin,
  utility, or subsystem owned by one component. Private implementation helpers do
  not require records.
- Family contracts describe behavior sibling components share.
- Design specs record human-owned visual and interaction decisions, including the
  cross-theme accessibility and contrast methodology used to judge token/color
  pairings.
- Theme specs record one package theme's intent, inherited base, selected token
  and palette mappings, required pairings/states, theme-specific exceptions,
  measured receipts, known gaps, compatibility, and artifacts.
- System specs record decisions that cross components or themes or change architecture.
- Consumer docs explain props, examples, and usage.
- Audit records hold current evidence and findings.

The reviewer starts with the changed code and the nearest current component or
module contract. They follow only the links needed for the question:

```text
changed code or theme source
  → nearest current component, module, or theme contract
  → relevant family or design requirement
  → architecture or system decision only when referenced
  → mapped tests and audit evidence
```

A current record may cite a previous human decision. When the new case is within
that decision's stated scope, the reviewer applies it without asking again.

Theme records sit between shared theming architecture and downstream records.
Cross-theme API, vocabulary, inheritance, validation, compiler behavior, and
artifact policy remain in architecture or system specs. Cross-theme human visual
and accessibility methodology for contrast belongs in a current design record;
shared measurement/tool implementation belongs to architecture or tooling. One
theme's selected token/palette mappings, required pairings and states,
exceptions, measured receipts, known gaps, migration, and artifacts belong in
its package-local theme record. Components and families continue to own
observable behavior; consumer docs continue to own supported syntax and examples.

Every record is either:

- `draft`: useful for review, but not a rule;
- `current`: explicitly approved and safe to rely on;
- `archived`: retained for history and linked to its replacement when one exists.

## Boundaries and invariants

- **INV1 — Current means approved.** Only `current` records guide implementation
  and review.
- **INV2 — One fact has one owner.** A component or theme record does not copy
  family, design, system, consumer, audit, or tooling content. Cross-theme API and
  compiler behavior stay in architecture/system records; human contrast
  methodology stays in design; shared measurement implementation stays in
  architecture/tooling; theme-specific mappings, states, exceptions, receipts,
  and gaps stay in the package-local theme record; aggregate observable component
  behavior stays in component/family records; independently contractible public
  component-module behavior stays in module records; consumer syntax stays in
  consumer docs.
- **INV3 — Existing decisions are reusable.** A reviewer cites an applicable
  decision and proceeds without asking the human again.
- **INV4 — New judgment is explicit.** A reviewer asks a human when no current
  decision applies, existing decisions conflict, or the choice is deliberately
  human-owned.
- **INV5 — Blank forms are not policy.** Templates only create drafts. Search
  and review never present template text as an approved Astryx decision.
- **INV6 — Required structure changes per kind.** Template wording may change
  without touching existing records. Adding a new kind does not migrate unrelated
  kinds. Adding or removing a required field or section from an existing kind
  creates a later schema definition for that kind and migrates every active record
  of that kind in the same pull request.
- **INV7 — Only pure spec changes use lightweight CI.** Every changed file must
  be a component, module, family, design, theme, or system spec. A change to code,
  architecture, guidance, templates, schemas, audits, or any unknown path runs
  normal CI.
- **INV8 — Private operations stay private.** Public records never name or link
  private release or automation systems.
- **INV9 — Current records have no implicit precedence.** A newer, narrower, or
  more local current record does not silently override another current record.
- **INV10 — Records describe ideal behavior, not pull-request verdicts.** A current
  record states durable requirements, prohibitions, compatibility, ownership, and
  evidence independently of any one implementation change. It never exists to
  approve a pull request and never approves, rejects, classifies, designates, or
  authorizes a specific one. Pull requests and issues may appear only as clearly
  non-authoritative examples, historical evidence, or references; the rule must
  remain complete without them. The reviewer owns each change's disposition
  against current authority.
- **INV11 — Every public delta has an authority result.** Every public API update
  and every public behavior change is matched to current committed authority
  before acceptance. Package-export shape is not the only trigger: reachable
  supporting types, context members, hook returns, defaults, and observable
  behavior participate too.
- **INV12 — Authors search before creating authority.** Before creating or
  materially expanding a record, search current records and open pull requests by
  proposed canonical owner/id, affected paths and exported symbols, and semantic
  behavior terms. Extend or project the existing canonical owner by default. A new
  record requires a distinct fact boundary and an explicit explanation of why no
  existing owner can contain it. Open pull requests coordinate overlapping work;
  they remain non-authoritative evidence.

## Writing specifications and contracts

These rules guide writing. They do not permit semantic compaction. They come from
directional evidence and project-owner judgment; the agent benchmark did not
measure human readability, so this is not a quantified readability claim.

Before writing:

1. Search current records for the behavior, public symbols, affected paths, and
   proposed canonical owner/id.
2. Search open pull requests for the same owner path, symbols, and semantic terms.
3. Update the canonical owner or coordinate with the overlapping work. Create a
   new record only when the fact has a distinct owner and explain that boundary in
   the pull-request summary.

Then write the contract:

- Use familiar words and short, direct sentences.
- State each rule once, beside the conditions and exceptions that control it.
- Use readable tables for branches or state matrices when they improve scanning.
  Never remove contract content merely to shorten a record.

Plain language must preserve normative force, predicates, cardinality, defaults,
compatibility, authority, owners, IDs, evidence state, and decision status. Do not
delete, weaken, merge, or hide distinct normative content. Replace a local fact
with a link only when this record's ownership rules assign that fact to another
canonical owner.

Qualifiers and authority verbs are contract semantics, not polish. Words such as
`only`, `every`, `consistently`, `current`, `records`, `owns`, `delegates`, and
`inherits` MUST NOT be dropped, generalized, weakened, or upgraded during a
rewrite. When reshaping a rule, keep its action, activating conditions,
exceptions or non-goals, owner, and evidence state in the same row or bullet as
the claim they limit.

Aim to keep a single specification record at or below 200 lines. This is a soft
readability ceiling, not a schema rule, validation gate, deletion target, or
reason to migrate accepted history. Exceed it when the full contract, exact
conditions, evidence boundaries, decisions, or required template structure need
more room. First remove true duplication, shorten prose without changing meaning,
use readable tables or lists, and link genuinely shared authority as INV2
requires. If the record still exceeds 200 lines, keep the content and explain why
in pull-request review. Do not minify tables or paragraphs to game the count;
human scanability wins.

### Same rule, plainer form

Dense:

> When `items` contains exactly one visible item, the component MUST announce that
> item exactly once; when `items` contains zero or more than one visible item, it
> MUST NOT announce an item, and consumers that omit `items` MUST retain the
> existing silent behavior.

Plain:

| Condition                           | Required behavior                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `items` is omitted                  | MUST keep the existing silent behavior. |
| Exactly one visible item is present | MUST announce that item exactly once.   |
| Zero or more than one is present    | MUST NOT announce an item.              |

The plain version changes the shape, not the meaning.

### Before review

- [ ] Compare the edited text with its source and confirm that every contract
      property named above remains explicit.
- [ ] Confirm each rule's action, conditions, qualifiers, exceptions or non-goals,
      owner, authority verb, and evidence state remain explicit and adjacent to the
      claim they limit.
- [ ] Confirm tables and lists improve scanning without hiding content; if the
      record exceeds 200 lines, explain why it needs the extra space.

### When current records disagree

1. A draft is context only and cannot conflict with current policy.
2. Identify the canonical owner from the fact's scope: aggregate component
   behavior, independent public module behavior, family behavior, design
   representation, one theme's semantics/mappings, cross-theme architecture,
   consumer usage, or audit evidence.
3. If two current records make different claims, review stops. Do not choose by
   recency, path proximity, or specificity; record a `novel-human` gap.
4. Resolve the gap by changing the canonical owner and removing the copied claim.
   A deliberate exception is recorded by that owner; affected records link to
   it instead of restating it.
5. A system-spec decision may authorize the change, but the current owning
   contract must change in the same pull request before reviewers rely on it.

## Change coupling

A document does not stay current by convention alone.

Before any component, module, family, design, theme, or architecture record becomes
`current`, the repository must support this flow:

1. The record names the code surface that can affect it and the checks that
   verify it.
2. A pull request touching that surface triggers a focused contract review.
3. The review records one of five results:
   - `preserves`: the exact delta restores or retains current authority without
     adding public API or behavior beyond it;
   - `settled`: an existing current human decision covers the exact delta and is
     cited;
   - `violates`: the exact delta contradicts current authority;
   - `novel-human`: no current authority settles the exact public API, behavior,
     ownership, compatibility, or design delta; or
   - `out-of-scope`: another component, module, family, system, or product owns it.
4. `preserves` and `settled` enter normal correctness review. They are eligible
   for approval only when the implementation and evidence also pass.
5. `violates` receives request-changes. The implementation conforms to current
   authority, or an owner-approved current spec update lands before acceptance.
6. `novel-human` enters a private human hold. No contributor-facing verdict or
   approval is published until the owning record contains the exact decision and
   becomes current.
7. A bug fix is `preserves` only when it restores existing current authority
   without changing public API or public behavior beyond that contract.
8. Audit freshness is computed from the same code and test relationship, so a
   relevant code change cannot leave an audit looking current.

### Recording a new human decision

1. A contributor explains the intended behavior in normal pull-request language
   and responds to review. They do not need to know the repository's spec system.
2. A reviewer or agent identifies any `novel-human` question. The contributor
   does not invent the answer.
3. An authorized owner answers in the pull-request review.
4. A maintainer or agent records that ruling in the canonical owning record.
   - Prefer a commit in the same pull request when maintainers can update the
     branch.
   - If they cannot update the contributor branch, open a small linked spec pull
     request below it and rebase the implementation after that decision lands.
   - If the direction is accepted, the contributor updates the code when needed.
   - If the direction is rejected, the rejected implementation is removed or
     changed. Record the rejected alternative only when the boundary is
     consequential and likely to come up again.
5. The final commits invalidate prior approval. The owner approves the exact
   heads after the record and implementation agree.

If no implementation direction is accepted, close the contributor pull request.
The maintainer-owned spec pull request remains only when the ruling is useful
independently.

Review comments are evidence of the conversation; the checked-in record is the
canonical decision.

Record the durable outcome, not the review transcript. A ruling belongs in a
canonical record when at least one is true:

- it changes or clarifies an owning component, module, family, or system boundary;
- it establishes a requirement or prohibition future work must preserve; or
- it rejects an alternative that is consequential and likely to recur.

A prop name, implementation mechanism, or failed visual experiment from an
abandoned pull request stays in review history unless that detail itself passes
this test.

Use a separate lower spec pull request only when the ruling changes a shared
contract beyond the contributor change and should land or be reused
independently. The implementation pull request then rebases onto that decision.

Examples:

- NumberInput changes its stepping math. Its current contract says the final
  operation clamps to `min`/`max`, and the mapped tests still pass. Result:
  `preserves`; continue to normal correctness review with no human question.
- A new NumberInput path uses the same previously approved transformation order.
  Result: `settled`; cite that `DEC` and continue to normal correctness review.
- A package-exported context changes a required function parameter while its
  current contract preserves the earlier operation shape. Result: `violates`;
  request changes or land an owner-approved compatibility decision first.
- Selector removes empty indicator space, but no current decision says whether
  option labels must stay aligned. Result: `novel-human`; hold privately while the
  owner decides and records the alignment contract.
- A product requests a one-off width prop for a family-owned input layout rule.
  Result: `out-of-scope`; route the change to the family contract rather than
  creating a component-specific API.

A draft record cannot clear a review gap. Only a verified `current` contract or
an applicable decision can produce `preserves` or `settled`.

The bootstrap does not mark any component, module, or family record current until
this flow passes the historical review benchmark and is enforced on pull requests.

## Owning code

- `AGENTS.md` points reviewers to the narrowest relevant record.
- `docs/templates/knowledge/` contains authoring forms.
- Component records are direct `<PublicName>.spec.md` children of a Core or Lab
  component root. The public name normally matches the root; a parent/member
  exception requires an exact top-level or full inline consumer-doc entry in
  that root. Public semantic module records are nested at least one directory
  beneath the same root as `<PublicName>.spec.md`; the parent component's
  `modules` list and the module's `parent_component` field must agree. Hidden,
  fixture, test, generated, build-output, coverage, dependency, and
  `*.generated.spec.md` paths are ignored consistently by discovery and PR
  routing.
- `packages/themes/<theme>/<theme>.spec.md` contains that package theme's
  canonical record; `docs/themes/README.md` is guidance and an index only.
- `docs/schemas/knowledge/` defines required structure.
- `scripts/check-knowledge.mjs` validates templates, records, and approval
  metadata.
- `.github/scripts/change-scope.cjs` identifies pure spec-record changes.
- `.github/workflows/spec-owner-gate.yml` binds approval to the exact pull
  request head. Theme approval derives from the committed union of
  `.github/ENGOWNERS` and `.github/DESIGNOWNERS`; record metadata never
  self-authorizes. The workflow enables auto-merge only for pure spec changes.

## Deciding specs

### DEC-1 — Current-record conflicts do not resolve by precedence

**Reference:** `architecture:knowledge-contracts/DEC-1`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-30`

A current record does not override another by being newer, narrower, or closer
to the code. Review stops, identifies the canonical owner, and resolves the
conflict there. Other records link to the owning decision rather than copying
it.

Rejected: silently choosing the newest or most specific record, because that
turns documentation order into unreviewed system policy.

### DEC-2 — New rulings normally stay in the contributor pull request

**Reference:** `architecture:knowledge-contracts/DEC-2`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-30`

A human ruling is normally discussed in the pull request that exposed the gap.
The contributor is responsible for explaining intent and changing their code;
maintainers and review agents are responsible for the spec system. They record
the ruling in the same branch when possible, or in a small linked lower spec PR
when the contributor branch cannot be updated. Rejected implementation is
removed or changed; a rejected alternative is recorded only when it protects a
consequential boundary from being debated again. Final exact-head approval
attests that the decision and implementation agree.

Rejected: requiring the owner to open a second pull request for every ruling,
because it separates the answer from the change and adds unnecessary review
work.

### DEC-3 — Search overlapping authority before writing

**Reference:** `architecture:knowledge-contracts/DEC-3`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-07`

Before drafting a new record or materially expanding one, search current records
and open pull requests using more than the proposed title: canonical owner/id,
affected paths, exported symbols, and semantic behavior terms. Extend or project
the canonical owner when the fact already belongs there. Create a new record only
for a distinct fact boundary and explain why the existing owner cannot contain it.

Rejected: searching only filenames or landed records. Semantic overlap may use a
different title, and open work may already be changing the same owner before it
lands. Open pull requests coordinate work and provide evidence; they do not become
authority.

Current enforcement gap: no checked-in gate yet proves the open-pull-request
search. Until one exists, the pull-request summary records the search terms,
canonical owner/path, and overlapping open work inspected.
